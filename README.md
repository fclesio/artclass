Why Capivara?
=====================================
Like my previous project [Urutu](https://github.com/fclesio/urutu-rent-home) 
(Search Homes in Berlin) I still just wanted to honor a typical Brazilian 
animal species. It has no special meaning. 

Capivara it's a nice animal, calm, gentle and lovely. 

According to Wikipedia "[The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent in the world"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara)
